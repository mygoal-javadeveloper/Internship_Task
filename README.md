ML_Internship_Task1.ipynb

**The task file is a Notebook and can be executed through Google Colab or Anaconda Jupyter**

Important:

How to convert gmail content to mbox for the dataset please refer [this link](<https://spinbackup.com/blog/how-to-import-mbox-to-gmail/>)

This will create data.mbox but since I have downloaded only inbox content thus my filename is Inbox.mbox

Other details are mentioned in the text cell of the Notebook
