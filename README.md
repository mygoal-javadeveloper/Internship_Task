**The task file is a Notebook and can be executed through Google Colab or Anaconda Jupyter**

Important:

How to convert gmail content to mbox for the dataset please follow the instructions given below

This will create data.mbox but since I have downloaded only inbox content thus my filename is Inbox.mbox

Other details are mentioned in the text cell of the Notebook

A few outputs of the code cell execution are deleted for security reason

# Steps get all the contents of Gmail (this task solution was done specific for Gmail):

  1. Login to Gmail
  2. Then got to https://myaccount.google.com/
  3. On left side you will find `Data & personalization menu`, click on it
  4. Then on right side scroll down and you will get `Download, delete, or make a plan for your data` in that you will find `Download your data`, click on it

  By default it is `MBOX format` that is supported for exporting Gmail. Also by default `All Mail data included` is selected. You can click on this box and select the required folders (Drafts, Inbox, Junk E-mail, sent, etc). I have selected only Inbox for my this task.
